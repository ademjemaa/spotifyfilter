# spotifyfilter

A spotify playlist maker through reddit top comments

To-Do List:

-make sure the same song isnt listed more than once in each playlist(WIP)

-filter out actual song names from rest of comment body perfectly(WIP)

-fix authentification token issues(prompt user to login with his spotify account on his device and export playlist to his playlists)(not even started)

-make this a callable bot on reddit (/u/spotifyfilter will fetch tracks in current thread, either on his own account or make a "spotify_filter" account that holds all playlists and returns and URL when is called)(I have 0 idea about this)
